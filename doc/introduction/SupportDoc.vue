            environments for the community users to seek support, post topics and discuss the technology. GitHub issue tracker is the channel where community users can create tickets however PrimeTek cannot guarantee an instant response time although
            they are monitored and maintained by our staff regularly. If you need to secure our response within 1 business day in addition to other benefits, you may consider the optional <NuxtLink to="/support">PRO support</NuxtLink> service
            instead.
