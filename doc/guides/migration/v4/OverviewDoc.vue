            At PrimeTek, we have been developing UI component libraries since 2008. The web continues to undergo technological advancements, and as a result, we have to modernize and update our libraries to stay relevant. PrimeVue v4 is the
            next-generation version that fully embraces modern Web APIs and removes technical debt like the legacy-styled mode. As part of our commitment to our products and the community, PrimeVue v3 will continue to be maintained until the end of
            2024.
